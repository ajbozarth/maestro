# Contributing to Maestro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Maestro! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI4quantum/maestro.git
cd maestro
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
```

3. Push your changes and create a pull request:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Style

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting and linting. To ensure your code meets our style guidelines:

1. Install development dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

2. Run the formatter:
```bash
uv run ruff format
```

3. Run the linter:
```bash
uv run ruff check
```

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. The format is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(agent): add new agent type"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`uv pip install -e .`).
2. Run the test suite (`uv run pytest`).
3. Run the formatter (`uv run ruff format`).
4. Run the linter (`uv run ruff check`).
5. Update documentation if necessary.
6. Create a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) - that the Linux® Kernel [community](https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message. If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in your `git config` file, you can sign your commit automatically by using the following command:

```bash
git commit -s
```

The following example includes a `Signed-off-by:` line, which indicates that the submitter has accepted the DCO:

```text
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

We automatically verify that all commit messages contain a `Signed-off-by:` line with your email address.

#### Useful tools for doing DCO signoffs

There are a number of tools that make it easier for developers to manage DCO signoffs.

- DCO command line tool, which lets you do a single signoff for an entire repo ( <https://github.com/coderanger/dco> )
- GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically ( <https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui> )
- Chrome - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo>
- Firefox - <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scott-rigby/?src=search>
